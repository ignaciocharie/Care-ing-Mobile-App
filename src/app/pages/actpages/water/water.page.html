      We know that drinking water is often overlooked as a necessary part of staying healthy. But, water
       also has been shown to have natural calming properties, likely as a result of addressing dehydration's 
       effects on the body and brain.

      Drinking enough water is an important step in managing your anxiety. Even if you're not experiencing anxiety, 
      drinking sufficient water can create feelings of relaxation. And also, can help you lose weight. This is 
      because water can increase satiety and boost your metabolic rate. Some evidence suggests that increasing 
      water intake can promote weight loss by slightly increasing your 
      metabolism, which can increase the number of calories you burn on a daily basis.
