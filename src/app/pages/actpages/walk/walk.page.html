      We know that walking can burn calories, ward off obesity and reduce the risk of heart disease 
      but your afternoon stroll might also have significant stress-relieving benefits, according to numerous studies.

      Taking a walk in the part could actually shift your brain into a calmer state, walking through green 
      spaces can put the brain into a meditative state. The act is found to trigger "involuntary attention," 
      meaning that it holds attention while also allowing for reflection. Try following a walking meditation 
      practice in one of your favorite parks to enjoy the health benefits of moderate physical activity while also 
      quieting the mind and increasing awareness.
